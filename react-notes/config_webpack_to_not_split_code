Answering my own question if anyone else stumbles upon this.

So, I realized that the Webpack config from create-react-app@3.0.1 ejection had code split configurations enabled. Which was splitting react library code from my code making it inexecutable.

Here are the settings I changed in the webpack config to get it working. (note that this is only advisable to do when developing chrome extension)

In webpack.config.js remove the configuration for splitChunks under optimization node, and set runtimeChunk to false.

...
optimization: {
  .
  .
  // remove spitChunks config
  splitChunks: {
     chunks: 'all',
     name: false,
  },
  runtimeChunk: true, // set this to false
}
...
the generated bundle will now be named as content.js (considering content as the entry point) link this content.js in your manifest.json under content_scripts and you're good to go.
